## App Features
This front-end application will have the following features:
1. Fetch and display a list of books related to flowers from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=flowers
2. Present the fetched data in a table, including book title, authors, and published date.
3. Enable users to view more details of a selected book, such as title, subtitle, authors, image, and description.
4. Encourage the candidates to showcase their creativity and add a personal touch to the application.
